# ⚙️ Installation

There are several ways to set up the SMB software stack on your personal computer:

1. **🚀 [RSS Workspace](rss-workspace.md)** *(Recommended)*
- Based on VSCode Dev Container (VSCode + Docker + Dev Container extension)
- The **smoothest** way to set up with pre-defined aliases and productivity tools.

2. **🐳 [SMB Docker](smb-docker.md)**
- Vanilla Docker setup with several helper scripts.

3. **🐧 [Local Installation](local-installation.md)** on Ubuntu 20.04
