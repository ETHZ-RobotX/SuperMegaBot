Please [create an issue](https://github.com/ETHZ-RobotX/rss_workspace/issues) for any missing library, package, driver, error, or any kind of unclear instruction related to the RSS Workspace.

The **RSS Workspace** is a all-in-one development environment for the Super Mega Bot (SMB). It contains all the necessary packages, tools, and configurations to develop, simulate, and test the SMB project.

Under the hood, the workspace uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [VSCode Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to provide a consistent development environment across different platforms.

This has been tested on the following platforms:
- ‚úÖ Ubuntu 22.04/20.04 AMD64
- ‚úÖ Windows 11 AMD64
- ‚úÖ MacOS Sonoma AMD64 and ARM64 (Apple Silicon)

For other Linux distros, the steps should be similar to Ubuntu and work for both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures. For Windows 10, the steps should be similar to Windows 11. The same applies to different versions of MacOS.

</p>


### VSCode + Dev Containers Extension
- Ensure you have a working VSCode setup and that it is up to date to avoid any issues.
- Install the [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) in VSCode.

### **(Optional)** Install Real VNC Viewer
- Required if you want to run GUI application with VNC. 
- Install Real VNC Viewer by following [the official website](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer)

### **(Optional)** SSH-agent
- To use SSH (for pushing commits to GitHub and connecting robots over SSH) inside container without copying your private ssh-key, you need to setup ssh-agent locally and add your ssh key to the ssh-agent. See the **preparation step 2** [here](https://github.com/ETHZ-RobotX/rss_workspace#preparation) for more details.

### **(Optional)** Fork the repository
- If you want to customize your workspace and save your changes, you can fork the repository to your GitHub account and clone the forked repository.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Open workspace locally

### **Method 1**: Clone the workspace to your local file system and open it in VScode.

{: .warning} 
> For **macOS** and **Windows** users, we recommend using **Method 2** to avoid performance issues.

>  </summary>
>  
>  The Dev Containers extension uses "bind mounts" to source code in your local filesystem by default. While this is the simplest option, on macOS and Windows, you may encounter slower disk performance when using `catkin build` or other disk-intensive operations. If you encounter this issue, consider using Method 2.
> </details>

##### Clone the workspace

```bash
# replace the URL with your forked repository if you have forked it
git clone https://github.com/ETHZ-RobotX/rss_workspace.git  

# Open the workspace in VScode. You can also open the folder in VScode manually.
code rss_workspace 
```

##### Reopen workspace in dev container
Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `F1` to open the command palette, type `Reopen in Container` and select the command to reopen the workspace in a Dev Container.

### **Method 2**: Clone the workspace to a docker volume and open it in VScode. 

[![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/ETHZ-RobotX/rss_workspace)

>  This method will clone the workspace to a docker volume. File data will be chunked and managed by Docker. Though, the chunked data are stored in the local file system, you cannot access them directly. This may be useful if you want to keep your local file system clean or if you encounter performance issues when using the workspace on macOS or Windows. To know more about the docker volume, please refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/).

## üõ†Ô∏è (Optional) Building the SMB Catkin Workspace
You can build all packages at once by running

```bash
catkin build
```

or build a specific package when needed by running

```bash
catkin build <package_name>
```

{: .warning }
> Be cautious, `catkin build` compiles files in parallel, which may quickly eat up your memory and CPU resource. We provide a shell alias `build-limit` to limit the number of parallel jobs and memory usage defined as follows:
>
> ```bash
> alias build-limit="catkin build --jobs 8 --mem-limit 70%"
> ```

{: .note}
`build-limit` and `catkin build` can be used interchangeably.

## üñ•Ô∏è Using the Terminal

### Integrated Terminal
We use `zsh` by default in the integrated terminal. You can set up your shell preferences in `.vscode/settings.json` or click the dropdown button in the terminal to select the default shell profile.

<img src="{{ 'images/terminal_dropdown.png' | absolute_url }}" alt="Terminal Dropdown" width="100%"/>

Every terminal opened inside VSCode sources the system ROS setup file by default. To source the RSS catkin workspace setup file in newly opened terminals, we provide a shell alias `wssetup` defined as follows:

```bash
alias wssetup="source ${ROOT}/devel/setup.zsh"
```

where `${ROOT}` is a pre-defined variable pointing to the workspace root directory inside the container. You can simply use `wssetup` to source the workspace in the terminal.

### Multiple Terminals with tmux
When working with ROS, it is often useful to have multiple terminals open. We provide a pre-configured tmux session with multiple panes. You can start the tmux session by clicking the dropdown button in the terminal and selecting `smb-tmux`.

<img src="{{ 'images/smb_tmux.png' | absolute_url }}" alt="Terminal Dropdown" width="100%"/>

{: .note}
`smb-tmux` runs `scripts/start_smb_tmux.sh` to start the tmux session under the hood. We highly recommend modifying the script to suit your needs. When remote accessing the the physical robots, you can copy the script to the physical robot and run it to have a similar tmux session.

---

## üë£ Additional Steps

### Windows Users

In each terminal, you have to manually set the `ROS_HOSTNAME`.

```bash
export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost
```

---

## üñºÔ∏è Visualizing GUI 

### Using X11 forwarding

{: .important}
**Works only on Linux**


This works out of the box in Linux; when a GUI is launched, the window pops up.

{: .note}
> Please note that this might have some rendering issues when the windows are resized, especially in RViz.

### Using VNC (remote desktop) (Recommended for Windows/Mac)

{: .important}
Works on Linux, Windows, and Mac

1. Modify the [line #20](https://github.com/ETHZ-RobotX/rss_workspace/blob/372af7b42366f53c7fa6f94b59a8d87f0e9c2255/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json#L20) in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to
```json
"DISPLAY": ":1"
```
and **optionally** modify the [line #9](https://github.com/ETHZ-RobotX/rss_workspace/blob/372af7b42366f53c7fa6f94b59a8d87f0e9c2255/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json#L9) in the same file to set the resolution of the VNC viewer.


2. Rebuild the workspace by opening the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and selecting `Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container`.

**Use VNC Viewer to connect to the desktop environment of the workspace.**

1. Open the RealVNC Viewer.
2. File -> New Connection.
3. Add `localhost:5901` as the VNC Server. The default password is `robotx`.
4. Click Ok.
5. Click and open the new connection.
6. Ignore the unencrypted connection issue.

Now you can see the desktop environment inside the VNC Viewer. You may need to adjust the picture quality settings in the VNC Viewer settings to get the best experience.

### Try a GUI application

You can try to run the smb gazebo simulation inside the workspace to see if the GUI application works. 

You can run the following command to start the simulation:

```bash
cd /workspaces/rss_workspace
catkin build smb_gazebo # Build the package if not built
source devel/setup.zsh # Source the workspace setup file if not sourced
roslaunch smb_gazebo sim.launch
```

If everything goes well, you should see the Gazebo simulation running and the GUI on your screen or VNC viewer.

{: #customizing-the-workspace}
## üé® Customizing the Workspace

{: .important}
To save your customization, you should fork the repository and clone the forked repository. You can then customize the workspace as needed and push the changes to your forked repository.

{: .note}
You can take a look of the following files and get an idea of what aliases/tools are pre-configured to make your life easier.

To further customize the workspace, you can:

* Add additional packages and productivity tools (e.g., `autojump`, `htop`, etc.) in the `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`.
* Add additional features and vscode extensions in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
* Add additional shell aliases and functions in the `.devcontainer/setup_alias.sh`.
* Add additional tmux configurations in the `.tmux.conf`.
* Customize you tmux session in the `scripts/start_smb_tmux.sh`.

{: #tips-and-tricks}
## üí° Tips & Tricks

### [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) 

#### **Use tmux in the workspace and remote access the physical robot via SSH**
Tmux is a terminal multiplexer; it allows you to create several "pseudo terminals" from a single terminal. It decouples the terminal from the main program (SSH at the remote), protecting it from being closed accidentally when connection is lost. It is particularly useful when remote accessing the physical robot via SSH, as it allows you to keep the program running even when the connection is lost and provides a multi-pane terminal interface for better organization.

#### **Tmux mouse mode**
We enable tmux mouse mode by default. You can use the mouse to switch between panes and scroll up and down in the terminal.

#### **Tmux panes synchronization**
You can toggle pane synchronization mode by pressing `Ctrl+b` and `Ctrl+s`. It is useful when you want to type the same command in multiple panes.

### GUI

#### **GUI Screen does not fit your screen in VNC?**
You can try,
- Hover over the top of the window to see the menu bar, click on the first icon from the left (the full-screen icon) to enter full-screen mode.
- Hover over the top of the window to see the menu bar, click on the second icon from the left (the scaling icon) to scale the screen to fit the viewer.
- Or adjust the default VNC resolution. See [VNC default resolution is too small?](#vnc_resolution_adjustment) for more details.


#### **Resize windows spawn inside VNC**
We use [fluxbox](http://fluxbox.org/) as the window manager in the VNC environment. It is more lightweight compared to the GNOME desktop environment.

To resize the windows, you can drag the window from the bottom left or right corner. If the window is too big to fit the screen, you can hold the `Alt` key and drag the window to move it around. If you just want to fit the window into the screen size, you can Right-click on the window title bar -> Maximize, this will fit the window into the screen size.

{: #vnc_resolution_adjustment}
#### **VNC default resolution is too small?**
Modify build arguments `VNC_RESOLUTION` in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file and rebuild the workspace.

### Shell

#### **reverse-i-search**
It is common to enter a command that you have used before. You can use `Ctrl+r` to search for the command in the history. We integrate `fzf` with the shell by default to provide a more interactive reverse-i-search experience.

#### **`Tab` completion in zsh**
We use `zsh` as the default shell. You can use `Tab` to auto-complete the command, file, directory name or even ros launch file parameters. When you press `Tab` twice, it will show you all the possible completions, and you can select the one you want by continuously pressing `Tab` until the cursor is on the desired completion.
