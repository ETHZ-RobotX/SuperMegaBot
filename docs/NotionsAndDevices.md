## Some Notions

### Git 
Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

### Ubuntu Terminal 
The Linux command line is a text interface to your computer. Often referred to as the shell, terminal, console, prompt or various other names, it can give the appearance of being complex and confusing to use.

* #### Export 
  A command in the Bash shell language. When used to set a variable, as in your example, the variable (PATH) will be visible ("exported to") any subprocesses started from that instance of Bash. Without the export command, the variable will not exist in the subprocess.
