# The SuperMegaBot
{:.no_toc}
Documentation of the SuperMegaBot (SMB) for the ETHZ Robotics Summer School.

* Table of contents
{:toc}

## Introduction
This documentation aims at introducing basic usage of the SMB software. 
To get a basic understanding and perform basic testing, a simulation environment based on Gazebo can be used.
This simulation is part of the core software setup.

Furthermore, the fundamentals in how to use the real robot is described as well.

## Issue tracking
Please use the [issues page](https://github.com/ETHZ-RobotX/SuperMegaBot/issues) to report any issues concerning the robots (hardware and software related issues). 

## The Simulation
For simulation of the SuperMegaBot, the Gazebo environment is used. 
It incorporates a simulation of the 4-wheeled robot including most of its sensors (16 beam Lidar, RGB camera, tracking camera, IMU)

### Installation
To install the simulation/SMB core software, follow the steps described in the [installation documentation](core-software/installation_core.md).

### Running the simulation environment
Once the SMB core software is installed, you can start the simulation by following the steps in [How To Run the SMB Software](core-software/HowToRunSoftware.md)

## Operating the real robot
Please follow the steps described in [How to use the SMB](robot-operation) to operate a SuperMegaBot.

## History
The SuperMegaBot was originally developped by the ETH Construction Robotics group.
