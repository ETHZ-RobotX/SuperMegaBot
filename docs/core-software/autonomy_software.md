## Remark
{:.no_toc} 

Please follow the steps described in the [installation documentation](installation_core.md) of the SMB core software before in order to prepare for the SLAM and navigation related software.

If you want to use the system on a real SMB robot with real sensors and actuators, the [hardware related part](../robot-operation/installation_hw_packages.md) should be installed **on top of the core part**. This document contains the instructions about SMB core software, which also contains the simulation environment.



## Path Planning
Once you've installed the [SMB core software](installation_core.md), you can directly follow the [documentation](https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/smb_path_planner/wiki) in the repository of the SMB Path Planner.

All the relevant repositories should already have been cloned into your catkin workspace when installing the core software.

Run the following command in the catkin workspace to build all the packages related to the path planner:
``` bash
catkin build smb_path_planner
```

## Mapping and Localization (SLAM)
The mapping and localization packages have only be tested on the real robot and on recorded datasets and has not been tested in the simulation environment.
{: .smb-mention }

As for the path planning software packages, also the mapping and localization related packages are already downloaded when you [cloned the list of repositories](../core-software/installation_core.html#catkin-workspace-and-all-packages) contained in `smb.repos` and [installed all the dependencies using the rosdep tool](installation_core.md#installing-dependencies). 

Just run the following command in the catkin workspace to build all the SLAM related packages:
``` bash
catkin build smb_slam
```
