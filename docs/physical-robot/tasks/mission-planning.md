# ðŸ“‹ Mission Planning

You can plan a set of waypoints or twist messages as your mission where SMB will autonomously execute the specified missions. For more information, refer to [smb_mission_planner](https://github.com/ETHZ-RobotX/smb_mission_planner). The mission planner is based on the popular state machine library `smach`.

Similar to the steps in [simulation](../../simulation/tasks/mission-planning.md).
