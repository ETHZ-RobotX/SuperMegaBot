# Preparations for SLAM Tutorial

## Download tutorial scripts and data

Download the following [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UYSW2WWhQVyTyuiPeuYasUF1EvQcqu1R?usp=sharing) which contains the tutorial scripts and maps. You can place this folder anywhere on your filesystem.

## Open3d Python install

You need to install the open3d python API which will be needed for tutorial on scan registration. We will use conda for this.

1. Install anaconda:  
    a. You can follow the instructions [here](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-anaconda-on-ubuntu-20-04/)  
    b. Type ```yes``` to the following prompt(```Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3 by running conda init?```)  
    c. Run the following command so that conda base is not automatically activated in every new terminal:  
         ```conda config --set auto_activate_base false``` 

2. Create a new conda environment:   
    ```
    conda create -n open3d_env python=3.8
    ```

3. Activate the conda environment:  
    ```
    conda activate open3d_env
    ```
4. Install open3d in the activated conda environment.
    ```
    pip install open3d==0.16.0
    ```

### Verify the installation  

Check the open3d version (it should be 0.16)

1. In a terminal activate the conda environment and open python console:
    ```bash
    conda activate open3d_env
    python
    ```
2. Import open3d and check the version:
    ```
    import open3d
    open3d.__version__
    ```

## Open3d_slam install (cpp package, required for online SLAM and Localization)

Make sure that you have installed the repositories following the instructions [here](https://ethz-robotx.github.io/SuperMegaBot/core-software/installation_core.html
) for core SMB software since we will be running online SLAM in Gazebo simulation.  

Some additional dependencies are required for Open3d_slam for which you can follow these steps:

```bash
sudo apt install libgoogle-glog-dev
sudo apt install libglfw3 libglfw3-dev
sudo apt install ros-noetic-jsk-rviz-plugins
sudo apt install liblua5.2-dev
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:roehling/open3d
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libopen3d-dev
```

You can now go to your smb workspace and directly build the package smb_gazebo and smb_slam by running the following command:

```bash
cd smb_ws # PATH TO YOUR WORKSPACE
catkin build smb_gazebo smb_slam
```

Additional information about Open3d_slam repo can be found here:
- [Repo](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/open3d_slam)
- [Docs](https://open3d-slam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

You have installed everything correctly if building ```smb_slam``` doesn't throw any error.

## Miscellaneous

### Download rosbags

In order to follow the tutorial you might need the following rosbags if you plan on creating an offline map:

- [First mission rosbag](http://robotics.ethz.ch/~asl-datasets/2023_RoboticsSummerSchool_testing_data/2023-06-16-11-33-01_smb263.bag)
- [Second mission rosbag](http://robotics.ethz.ch/~asl-datasets/2023_RoboticsSummerSchool_testing_data/2023-06-16-11-39-50_smb263.bag)
- [Challenge site rosbag](http://robotics.ethz.ch/~asl-datasets/2023_RoboticsSummerSchool_testing_data/2023-06-16-11-45-45_smb263.bag)
