# Preparations for Path Planning Tutorial

To prepare for the Tutorial on Path Planning, please set up the planners as describe in [SMB Navigation](../../simulation/tasks/navigation.md) and the [SMB Exploration](../../simulation/tasks/exploration.md).

If everything runs, then the software is working and ready for the tutorial.
