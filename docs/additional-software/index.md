## 📋 Mission Planner

A mission plan defines the logic of how and when different missions are executed. The mission plan is implemented as a smach state machine. Each mission has its own mission data, containing relevant information for the mission (e.g., its waypoints). For more details, please refer to the [MissionPlanner](https://github.com/ETHZ-RobotX/smb_mission_planner).

## 📚 Some Notions

### 🌐 Git 
Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

For more info, please refer to this [link](https://medium.com/@itswisdomagain/git-101-introduction-to-git-for-newbies-bb14f6f9fc1).

### 🖥️ Ubuntu Terminal 
The Linux command line is a text interface to your computer. Often referred to as the shell, terminal, console, prompt, or various other names, it can appear complex and confusing to use.

For more info, please refer to this [link](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview).

#### 📤 Export 
`export` is a command in the Bash shell language. When used to set a variable, the variable (e.g., `PATH`) will be visible ("exported to") to any subprocesses started from that instance of Bash. Without the `export` command, the variable will not exist in the subprocess.
